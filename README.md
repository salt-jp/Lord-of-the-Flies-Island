# Lord-of-the-Flies-Island

This code it not only pulled from, but it is also based on the book Lord of the Flied by William Golding. What the island looks like is very important to understanding the story, but because there is no concrete map of the island, it is often fuzzy within the readers imagination. So with this code, it can make a general outline of the setting of the story if it is viewed from on its side. From left to right there is an outline firstly of the mountain, then there is the scar where the beach is, then the forest, and lastly the final point of elevation is castle rock. Everytime this code is run, new words form which slightly changes the shape of the island, but still gives the same general shape because the island from this book is different in every readers mind. This technique was inspired by Robert Frosts "Mending Wall," as he makes the outline of the wall from said poem.
